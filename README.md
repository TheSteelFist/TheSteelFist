Interactive and autonomous systems have always appealed to me given its multipurpose application. 
I have always dreamt of building a self-sufficient, fully interactive virtual world which would open a new dimension on how we perceive our daily lives.<br>

💻 I love to work on all kinds of projects, because every little thing helps when you least expect it.<br>

Languages and Tools I'm familiar with:

When I'm not studying or working towards the craziest dream, I indulge myself in a bunch of activities that can be considered as my guilty pleasure.<br>
🎸🎻 One of them is playing heavy metal songs on my guitar or some classical pieces on the violin (Two ends of the spectrum? On closer inspection they're very similar)<br>
🥘🍰 I also love to cook and bake, most of which is very edible!<br>
📚📖 Learning languages is a newfound hobby of mine, Japanese being the latest addition to the list. アニメが大好きだから ;)<br>
🎨✏️ I also like to sketch portraits and paint landscapes! It's usually sketching because pencil is the quickest to reach out for(although it demands way more patience).<br>
