Interactive and autonomous systems have always appealed to me given its multipurpose application. 
I have always dreamt of building a self-sufficient, fully interactive virtual world which would open a new dimension on how we perceive our daily lives.<br>

I love to work on all kinds of projects, because every little thing helps when you least expect it.<br>

When I'm not studying or working towards the craziest dream, I indulge myself in a bunch of activities that can be considered as my guilty pleasures. 

One of them is playing heavy metal songs on my guitar or some classical on the violin (Two ends of the spectrum? On closer inspection they're very similar).

I also love to cook and bake, most of which is very edible.

Learning languages is a newfound hobby of mine, Japenese being the latest addition to the list. アニメが大好きだから ;)
